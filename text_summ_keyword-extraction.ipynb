      "It is a bacterial disease that mainly affects the lungs causing great discomfort.It is a chronic lung diseaseThe bacteria that cause TB are spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes.Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body.Most people infected with the bacteria that cause tuberculosis don't have symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they usually include a cough (sometimes blood-tinged), weight loss, night sweats and fever.Treatment isn't always required for those without symptoms. Patients with active symptoms will require a long course of treatment involving multiple antibiotics .Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those affected.More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries, and more than 50% in India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000.About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 5â€“10% of people in the United States population test positive by the tuberculin test. Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times.It's treatment was discovered to be antibiotics.Antibiotics help get most of the patients healthy.\n",
